We begin with importing our libraries and then loading our dataset which I have named as 'df'.
After that we check the datatypes of our dataset to make sure each column corresponds to its datatype.
We  then proceed with tidying our dataset by removing any missing values and also checking whether there are any duplicates in our dataset.
There are some column names with typos and after fixing that we head on to our univariate analysis.
Here we look at:
   The country with the highest number of individuals with access to bank accounts,
   the type of location with the highest number of individuals having access to bank accounts in the four countries (Rural or Urban),
   the country with the highest number of individuals coming from Rural areas having access to bank accounts,
   the age group with the highest financial inclusion,
   access to bank accounts over the years,
   gender with the highest financial inclusion and
   the relation between having cell phone access to financial inclusion.
After that we cover the measures of central tendency and the measures of dispersion.
Once done with univariate analysis we begin bivariate analysis where we use scatter plots and line graphs to look at the relationship between different variables.
We also take a look at the correlation between the different variables using the pearson coefficient method.
Finally we begin our multivariate analysis. Here we perform different kinds of analysis.
They include:
   Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
   Factor Analysis
   Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
We look at these three types of multivariate analysis to prioritize and to reduce the number of variables we have to deal with in our dataset, without losing the essence of the data collected.
